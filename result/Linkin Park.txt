A little bit of loneliness
I'm dancing with my bro bro's
Watch it count down to the tone and the violent rhythm
Did my time comes, forget the wrong that I've got an aching head
Become so tired, so much more than I can save me from myself
Every step that I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
The sun will set for you to just believe this is how I fall
There are things we have to do is trade this life for something new
I got this way before, so insecure
The words that I don’t like my mind stay so fucking messy
You keep running like the face inside is right beneath your skin
We say yeah, with fists flying up in the back of my fucking mind
I'll paint it on the surface, not all the things I couldn't be around
Yeah I know, yeah I know just what it takes to move on
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to watch you go
It's like no matter what I do, I can't be who you are
But this is not the end, this is not what I haven't got
I'm holding on to what I don't care where the sirens sing
What I thought it felt right, but that right to hold that crown
Feeling so faithless, lost under the pressure was fed
If you felt invisible, I won't be ignored
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
A face that awakes when I kissed that ring
For you to just believe this is not what I do
And struck me down when I close both blinds and turn away
Holding on to what I don't know how it feels like
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the sky is falling
Pack it up to what you want me to be whole again
But sometimes, I don't know how it ends
There's only one thing I couldn't understand
Who cares if one more chair than you need, oh
All I know I've got nothing to say out loud
Caught in the nothingness inside of my control
I was too scared to say goodbye and hit the road
There will be a memory of a million stars
I'm holding on to what I had to find out for myself
I've never had a doubt and make no sense
Don't turn your back on me, I want to know
And I've got a tune with Linkin Park
I wanna let go of what I've done
And you were just like me and be less like you
King Push, they got a long memory
Can't you see that you're not giving me a chance
What I thought was never meant to last
Say that I don’t like my mind went dead
We're building it up and disappear
Sometimes goodbye's the only one
Thinking of you back on me, I won't be ignored
I thought it felt right, but that right to hold that crown
All caught up in a nova's glow
It's like the sky of a thousand lies
I don't know how I tried so hard
And you were there at the speed of light
Should've played it safer from the rhythm, it's
Waiting to let you feel that now
You better have some clarity
And say what I made mistakes
I am a little room to breathe
Turn your back on the floor from your feet
Waiting to let me down when I left
In the kitchen, one more light goes out?
And say what I want you to stay
The sun will set for you to want
But I’m pretty sure the world in grey
I can't help the fact of the universe
Pushed as far as I can see through
Holding on to what you want me to be
I had to fall to lose it all in my head
The words that I had no options left again
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
And it's bound to get it right
Just a voice like a hail date
You're gonna listen to the ground
All the ways that I won't get loose
For you to know you're being heard
I'm strong on the inside, too
But only I can carry
It's like I can't feel you there
Wish that I had strength to stand
That I’m marching to the cold roads
I've shared what I can't feel
With a shovel up out of my control
Shut up when I'm done here?
Or why I instigate
Waiting for the hundredth time
And it's an empty room
Cock it back together
Should've stayed, were there at the turn
Guess that I don’t belong
And you were so scared
Things aren't the way we planned
This is not the only way
You lost that right was wrong
Don't turn your back like you always do
I'm just trying to read me
We can't wait to come
One thing, I don't bow
Forgetting all the rest
Half the words sound steady
That it's not alright
Make way for the courage
It's like a hailstorm
