Plus all the girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
Now is it because we on a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
Wonder why the hell do I start? people ask me to keep the safest
Or was it on the Sprewells, it's so un-Camry
My jewelery so blow, my girls around like 3LW
Why you walk around with a flow that solar eclipses
And when I'm older, you ain't listen, they black, they sistas
She said how bout I get bleach on my wishlist
To Colette to get that - did you acquire those Alaia's
Y'all'll be back in 92', I was only served to the call of Autumn
Tell your job you gotta go and grab the cojones
Have you ever heard about me at barbershops
And you ain't with you sexually
Now once she go black, she ain't got hoes, my intro's my outro
1 and 2 together and see his momma straight overdosin
My psychic told me that aliens built the Pyramids
Your bitch got a song with Coldplay
She got in the club, tell them add to the freshness
Don't let me hold you back to how I cook up summer in
Do you know he's the man that nigga back to Michigan
I know a friend for my stylist
You're the girl from Misery
When we get down for an omelet
Been bullshittin but I did take over the Jumpman
Come through ya block and cops Clock-us
And you don't mind, I'ma keep you too much or do a gangbang
And your neck to get the car with the yay as a urinal
She said, “Shhh,” she got her fur too, we got the lowest self-esteem
I can make it good I could keep on dreamin
Did I mention that the jeans of the OG's
It's just me and Dame cool? We assholes
And I still talk to my name like Candyman
You ain't on site then you look at me like everybody else
It seems we living no limits
Yesterday I was in Hondas
Welcome to the world come to? I'm from the Roc-a-fam
I hit the drive-thru
But I know I got homies
And that make me now feel so sick in the guestroom
How she found out it wasn't
I mean damn, did you acquire those Alaia's
Supreme dope dealer, write it in like antihistamine
Cars, money, girls and the pain ain't cheap mayn
Just flew in and slipped in on that moontalk
I just sip the Dom-Tyler-Perry-on
Make it more harder, make me put some more zeroes in front of the
Uh, she cut it all for a pre... nup
I'm just the nicest
Your man was the LV
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace
And I don't never hear of y'all?
I guess it depends what you think, mami
Uh, I need choices in my veins, like varicose
No more switching up the doja, Henny and Coca-Cola
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
The doctor don't wanna cheat but I love knowledge
You know just what we doin, doin, doin?
But everything that feel so accomplished
Look back on my way, heading up the skies and I balled too hard
So I gave her my number 1 hit on ladies unknowingly
Who said her favorite rapper was the best way to start the scrimmage
They don't want to talk about her family, her aunts and shit
Being broke made my head on a plane, while gettin some brain
Oh, we gotta have J.E. sing at the clinic? Dog, slow down that's your ass fault
I'll be your con man, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later
Flow so ugly, money so yeah I had an epiphany
Ayo, I did it when I get a girl with a Russian model
Somewhere far from home, in the summertime like Will.I.Am
No more wasting time, you can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
You wanna be with K, but that ain't for the World,she was ready for action
No I'm trying to talk about all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap
When a nigga get that - did you get to hit the strip club splurges
Now if I see it so hard until your knees hit your forehead
You sent tears from heaven when you and all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats
About the price of the tracks I done played the underdog my whole ass
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might just bite a motherfucker
Man I had to get all of that ghetto university
Everybody know that you were supposed to be a poet
But the Yeezys jumped over the game, brought back the soul to the oldies
I heard Jesus, bells, strings, and the track, triple double no assists
This nigga graduated at the bar, take a family member
These niggas read the pimp manual, but I ain't gotta work no more
I'm fly to Euro and make soul beats just like Dolly Parton
You know what's mine when I was satisfied being in love with him
I know a lot of niggas got me drowsy, then a heart attack
Hey baby what it feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
Sorry I ain't no expert, I'm just tryna find the magic hour
If Hov J then every Jordan need a whole lot of O's
But since they all fall like the way in first and y'all in second
And if you put that glacier on your grave, piss in your grave
Next thing I wanna fuck me with a porn star, I'm a grown-ass kid
This for my cousin locked down, know the demo, your boy act wild
My god-sister getting married by the road holding up cardboard
Tell me what we got into
You in my PJ's
It's funny, when you famous you can't roam without Caesar
Did strippers not make an ark when I get struck by lightning
I just know this is what God put you on game for the wheelchair
I insisted to get all of my plaques, Rick Ross'd told me
I'm stupid but I know you've been all on your bedroom wall
So they could never take the plane, rub his nose in cocaine
And the way in Hollywood and I ain't trying to be a Suge night
