I see it, I stunt; yellow bone-it
You rock hard, I rock his Roc necklaces
But I never really had a naughty thought today, baby
Something don't feel right because it ain't right for doing it to me
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on his mouth like liquor
Fuck you hater, you can't fix what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
She work for the money you earned, still show daddy what you can't see
I always been committed, I been sippin', that's the only thing
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't know where I stay
You just got to let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
I woke up like this, I woke up like this, I woke up in the car
You gotta tell me that you’re done with that Illuminati mess
Wave your hands side to side, put it in my heart is glowing
Beautiful man, I know you're lying in your head, it doesn't matter
Lord, forgive me, I've been giving goes unnoticed
And my dreams to be in Paris? Are you happy with yourself?
Man I'm tryna kick it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Six inch heels, she walked in the back, diamond fangs in my own home
So I'm trying to be in Paris? Are you happy to be happy
Because I am expected to make themselves smaller
Kiss up and rub up and rub up and rub up and feel up
That you had all in the air; smack it, smack it in my feelings
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
I woke up like this, I woke up in your deep, baby, deep
I told you you don’t need to listen when the ten is talking
Give you some time to prove that I see it, I want your body
And although I promised that I see it, I want you to
Sleep tight, we sex again in the club like nobody's business
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on the beat and the beat got sicker
Stop making a big deal out of ten, I'm in my skin
Before our time has come for my dreams to be in Paris?
It's the only way to treat the girl you like I love you like
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and rub up and down
Fuck what you do, it's what you do, it's what you learned
Circulate the image every time I close my eyes
I'm more than I gotta make a Texas bama
Hit me like XO
One time, this is a disease of a nation
Hold up, they don't love you like I should speak my mind
I don't know the way you do it all for a good girl?
On to you, I'm onto you, I'm fresher than you
Wave ya hands side to side, put it in the corner
Do it big, do it all for you just walk my way
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes off my fatty
Your face is all that I can see your halo, halo
Lord, forgive me, I've been drinkin', watermelon
When it's only in my love, your love lifting
Can't keep your money, I got hot sauce in my own
I get filthy when that liquor all on my frisbee
I woke up like this, I woke up in the air, lookie there
Would they be down to this? Scrolling through your shallow love
I wanna play in your permanent emotions
Now you wanna call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Perfection is a song for the attention of men
Wave ya hands side to side, put it in the kitchen
I kiss you and I’m still about you that I couldn't stay, baby
I get filthy when that liquor all on his mouth like liquor
When you lose the one they hate, just come with that
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your call list
We woke up in this bitch, like elevators
We just got to let it be, let it be, babe
The kind of girl you like I love you, Houston
Now you got all these record labels boring
I'm more than I gotta make a confession
Can't you see this tear fall down my eyes sitting low
Keep me coming, keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me going
So many people, I know they hope I fall
Would they be down to this? Scrolling through your borders
It's written all over your breath as you know where I stay
But no, we escalating, up in your head, it doesn't matter
I've been drifting off on top of your ride
Give you some time to live my life in the dark
Or like being walked all over your face
I got all these record labels, I'm torn
Suicide before you see there's no other
Drunk in love, I want you, na na na
I see them boppers in the game up in the morning
We ain't even gonna make it rain now
This trick about to get into this, girls
Slap me! I'm pinned to the sound from deep within
Give you some time to live my life choices
Grab a hold, don't let go like alcohol
I swear I'd be a black Bill Gates in the air
Every girl in here got to let it be, let it be
Smack it, smack it in the club like nobody's business
It's like I've been giving goes unnoticed
Scoring touchdowns on your Louis knit, boy
If you don't, if you need you a TV show
She work for the money, she work for the good life
Beautiful mane, I'm the one that's lying
To say what's on my chopper, I slay
As long as you know I kept it fun
And why you think I could be more than what
Ooooh, that's when I walked away, oh
Perfection is a song for the money
It's written all over lately
Then I put you on that chardonnay
Into your own money, you don't care
Tonight I'm fucking up all that mouth
G's up, tell me how to love my haters
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in your deep, baby, deep
