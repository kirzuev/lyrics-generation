Oh, you a happy home, when it seems heaven-sent
You was just a misery
Now you tell me who knows, a peaceful place where thugs get in
Cost me more to be a pappy
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me as a ridah
I gets down like a bullet
I just a misery
My niggas, we the realest
But when I was a black Bimmer
Well, baby, if you ever need me, call, I'll be locked up state
2Pacalypse Now don't stop for hoes, I get around, the Underground
If I told you that I understand: you are appreciated
No one knows my struggle, they only see the same bitch who was in the game
Black love, brown pride, and the and the rose petal got all kind of
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the criminals and drug dealers
If you find it, I'll be there to know it seem hard sometimes
Round and round, around we go and every black male's trapped
Fuck everybody else, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
When I talk about money, all you motherfuckers feel us
When it's time to ride, I was more shocked than anything
Uh, and my pistol and my dawgs ain't have a toast for the paper
You probably crooked as the last ones left, and life goes on
To keep me happy there's no way I can see, that you don't know?
Look for me, lost in Hell, to live if I'm just living to fight?
Be a lie If I could recollect before my friends, so here we go
Why am I dying to live if I'm still the thug that you love to hate
You see, this is for the homies that I never thought of death
Of how I'd rock the mic and make good out of the dirty, nasty
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it now I’m under pressure
Now it's time to roll, you got the heart to fight for what is mine?
Lord, I suffered through the night, there's a heaven for a G
“Street Science, you’re on the hips as I leave, it’s like a dream
That was in my heart you was trouble but I was a fool
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you hear about the groupie hoes
I won't deny it, I'm a thug nigga until the day I die
It came from a woman alive that could take the pain away
If I'm insane, it's the place to rest through this oppression?
I say the words that can express how I live my life as thugs
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the late night clubs drink them buds
You know, it's funny, when it seems but, by keepin its dreams
And every time we chill is when we out mashin'; me and my chips
Forever live, and I don't get caught up in the old school
But ain't no future bright for me, lost in the younger days
Maybe you can make it through the hard times, worrying faces
We got four niggas in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
In the city, the city of angels and constant danger
I blew trial, no more will you see me in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Round and round, around we go, every other video
Was hyper as a ghetto child, raised in this shit
And hocus pocus, I try to fatten our pockets
A couple of movies, now the road got rough, you're alone
We can keep in the cemetery, shed so many peers
I gotta hit you with the Underground, when we played as kids
You've got to be love, happiness and companionship
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was just about Biggie
No love from my everday fits I ain't mad at cha
I got a house that's full of pain while the weapons blaze
You can't complain you was our nigga, but you still stay
When everybody wanna see us locked in chains
Motherfucker, let's get smoked out, and blazed the weed
Started out my clip, never stop until I bust this
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother get a bulletproof
We all wrapped up in your eyes just like a coward
Turn them off! Time to give her was my mama's place
And if we bust out this shit I gotta stay strapped
Time to give her was my only wish to follow me
You're too old to understand the way you planned it
They got some smokers on, whistle as I walk by
We all wrapped up in the dark, will we survive through the years
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this world of sin
Picked you up to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
Well, this is for the throw down, the shit's about to act up
Pour out some liquor and I don't got be the same drama
Why am I trying to give it to the big man on the couch
Needy hookers got a A-P-B out on my level
You're lame so I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
That's why I love you black or white, ‘cause we human
I guess them nightmares as a thug nigga
They tell me how you want it if it's that easy
‘Cause when I used to let you get stranded
That's just the way yo, get out the way it is, aww yeah
Go toe to toe when it's time to kill for our women
Writing to my future, ‘cause my anger
What's the worst they can do it over on this track
So much trouble in the morning and we was the same ho
And shed so many questions and they ask for
Screams in the hood swoll
But tell the cops when you see I'm buster-free?
You niggas can't feel it, we the last ones left, but life goes on
And our fate is a calculated step
Dear departed, I shed tears with my Glock
‘Cause every nigga in L.A. on bail
Forever live, and I reminisce
So many questions and they ain't got hoods
And there's no limit to the bloody end
With my AK, I'm still tipsy from last night
Never no more smiles for a stranger
Only place that's right for me it's reversed
But recognize and it's all about you
And all the people and politics we address
You know what I had, and plenty wishes
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, see it clearly
